# FAI vagrant image builder

This repository contains the code to build the Debian Vagrant base boxes available at
https://app.vagrantup.com/debian
See that URL for the end user documentation.
This repository is based on https://salsa.debian.org/cloud-team/debian-cloud-images with the following Vagrant specific enhancements:

- priority based package selection: all packages with Priority Essential, Important, Standard are installed, to match the package selection done by the debian-installer
- generation of a standard OVF file for VirtualBox OVA import
- generation of package in box format, including a default Vagrantfile
- end to end test suite for VirtualBox and libvirt boxes (bare metal hardware is needed for running the test suite for VirtualBox)

## Getting started

You will need a checkout of this repository on your disk and a recent fai-server
package (at least 5.7) installed.
```
  # git clone https://salsa.debian.org/cloud-team/debian-vagrant-images.git
  # sudo make install-build-deps
```

  Call `make help` and follow the instructions

Example 1:

```
   # make bullseye-vagrant-amd64
```

This will create some log output and the following files:

- debian-bullseye-vagrant-amd64-official-20210409-1.info
- debian-bullseye-vagrant-amd64-official-20210409-1.build.junit.xml
- debian-bullseye-vagrant-amd64-official-20210409-1.raw
- debian-bullseye-vagrant-amd64-official-20210409-1.tar

## Boxes creation

To convert the raw disk images into a usable vagrant box you will need
```
# apt install libxml-writer-perl libguestfs-perl uuid-runtime
```
then call the target
```
make build-virtualbox-bullseye-vagrant-amd64
```

## E2E tests
To run the end-to-end tests you will also need
```
apt install vagrant vagrant-libvirt virtualbox
```

Then if you call
```
make test-virtualbox-bullseye-vagrant-amd64
```
a box called virtualbox-debian-bullseye-vagrant-amd64-official-20200421-1.box
will be created in the current directory, and a test environment based on this box will run the e2e tests.

## Uploading boxes to Vagrant Cloud
To upload the boxes, you will need:
- the trickle package, which is a bandwidth usage limiter
- the VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN set as an environment variable

Then if you call
```
   #  make NAMESPACE=debian IS_RELEASE=norelease upload-virtualbox-bullseye-vagrant-amd64
```
The box virtualbox-debian-bullseye-vagrant-amd64-official-20200421-1.box will be uploaded to
'https://app.vagrantup.com/debian/', and you will have to release it manually on the app.vagrantup.com/debian website

# Continuous Integration

Contact: Lucas Nussbaum <lucas@debian.org>

The CI pipeline configuration (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) is generated by a script. See `.gitlab-ci.yml.generator`

The CI pipeline runs on <https://www.grid5000.fr/>, which provides bare metal nodes for testing.

Most of the details are in scripts installed locally on a virtual machine (debvagrant-vm.lille.grid5000.fr).
Once you have been given access, connect using:
`ssh -J debvagrant@access.grid5000.fr root@debvagrant-vm.lille.grid5000.fr`

Then look into `/srv/ci-runner-scripts/bin/debvagrant` which should be easy to follow.

If you need an node for interactive usage, use `/srv/ci-runner-scripts/bin/debvagrant --get`

Note that due to [this gitlab issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223012), the GitLab pipelines page is really hard to read. It is recommended to use [a custom CSS to work around this](https://bascht.com/tech/2020/11/18/better-gitlab-pipeline-ux-with-custom-css/), that is, set up a custom CSS for <https://salsa.debian.org/cloud-team/debian-vagrant-images/-/pipelines/>
with:
```
.gl-label {
    border-radius: 0.35rem
}

.pipeline-graph .build {
    width: auto;
}

.pipeline-graph .gl-text-truncate {
    overflow: visible;
}

.pipeline-graph .build .build-content {
    border-radius: 10px;
}

.pipeline-graph li.build[id*="sandbox"] .ci-job-component .menu-item {
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #3df006;
}
```
